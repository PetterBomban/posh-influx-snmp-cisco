## posh-influx-snmp-cisco

**PS:** This is currently very work in progress. The goal is to be able to get the most relevant information from Cisco devices (ASA, IOS, NX-OS) via SNMP, and the push it to InfluxDB and Grafana. Right now I'm only working on ASA.

SNMP walk and SNMP get gotten from https://vwiki.co.uk/SNMP_and_PowerShell.
